# DeepMed-AI
The folder "web" contains three files: html, css, and js for DeepMed AI frontend.

The nodeExpress contains two files for backend.

Frontend enables users to log in and chat through n8n chat weidget, the conversations are sent and analyzed via n8n workflow. After the report is done, it will then be documented in the Google Sheets. Afterwards, users can retrieve their report via button "View My Report" after entering the rerquest ID they received at the beginning of chat. User emails are collected only for website traffic tracking.
